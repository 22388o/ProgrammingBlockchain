## Bitcoin Address {#bitcoin-address}

You know that your **Bitcoin Address** is what you share to the world to get paid.  
![](../assets/BitcoinAddress.png)  
You probably know that your wallet software uses a **private key** to spend the money you received on this address.  
![](../assets/PrivateKey.png)  

The keys are not stored in the network and they can be generated without access to the Internet.  

With code:  
```cs  
Key privateKey = new Key(); // generate a random private key
```  
From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a **public key**.  

![](../assets/PrivKeyPubKey.png)  
```cs 
PubKey publicKey = privateKey.PubKey;
Console.WriteLine(publicKey); // 0251036303164f6c458e9f7abecb4e55e5ce9ec2b2f1d06d633c9653a07976560c
```  

> **Fact:** TestNet is a Bitcoin network for development purposes. Bitcoins on this network worth nothing.  MainNet is the bitcoin network everybody knows.  

You can magically get your **bitcoin address** from your public key and by specifying the **network**. *(You should enjoy this magic now, because I will clear it up shortly.)*  

![](../assets/PubKeyToAddr.png)  

```cs 
Console.WriteLine(publicKey.GetAddress(Network.Main)); // 1PUYsjwfNmX64wS368ZR5FMouTtUmvtmTY
Console.WriteLine(publicKey.GetAddress(Network.TestNet)); // n3zWAo2eBnxLr3ueohXnuAa8mTVBhxmPhq
```  

**More accurately a bitcoin address is made up of a Base58check encoded combination of your public key’s hash and some information about the network the address is for:**  

![](../assets/PubKeyHashToBitcoinAddress.png)  

```cs 
var publicKeyHash = publicKey.Hash;
Console.WriteLine(publicKeyHash); // f6889b21b5540353a29ed18c45ea0031280c42cf
var mainNetAddress = publicKeyHash.GetAddress(Network.Main);
var testNetAddress = publicKeyHash.GetAddress(Network.TestNet);
```  

> **Fact:** The hash of the public key is generated by performing a SHA256 hash on the public key, and then performing a RIPEMD160 hash on the result, with Big Endian notation. The function could look like this: RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey))  

The Base58Check encoding has some neat features, such as checksums to prevent typos and a lack of ambiguous characters such as '0' and 'O'.  

```cs 
Console.WriteLine(mainNetAddress); // 1PUYsjwfNmX64wS368ZR5FMouTtUmvtmTY
Console.WriteLine(testNetAddress); // n3zWAo2eBnxLr3ueohXnuAa8mTVBhxmPhq
```  

> **Fact:** Practicing Bitcoin Programming on MainNet makes mistakes more memorable.  

You might not know that as far as the Blockchain is concerned, there is no such thing as a Bitcoin Address. Internally, the Bitcoin protocol identifies the recipient of Bitcoin by a payment script, we call it **ScriptPubKey**.  

![](../assets/ScriptPubKey.png)  
A ScriptPubKey may look like this:  
```OP_HASH160 14836dbe7f38c5ac3d49e8d790af808a4ee9edcf OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG```  

It is a short script that explains what conditions must be met to claim ownership of bitcoins. We will go into the types of instructions that can be given in a ScriptPubKey as we move through the lessons of this book.  

We are able to generate the scriptPubKey from the Bitcoin Address. This is a step that all bitcoin clients do to translate the “human friendly” Bitcoin Address to the Blockchain readable address.

![](../assets/BitcoinAddressToScriptPubKey.png)  

```cs 
Console.WriteLine(mainNetAddress.ScriptPubKey); // OP_DUP OP_HASH160 14836dbe7f38c5ac3d49e8d790af808a4ee9edcf OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Console.WriteLine(testNetAddress.ScriptPubKey); // OP_DUP OP_HASH160 14836dbe7f38c5ac3d49e8d790af808a4ee9edcf OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Console.WriteLine(publicKeyHash); // 14836dbe7f38c5ac3d49e8d790af808a4ee9edcf
```  

Notice the ScriptPubKey for testnet and mainnet address is the same?  
Notice the ScriptPubKey contains the hash of the public key?  
We will not go into the details yet, but note that the ScriptPubKey appears to have nothing to do with the Bitcoin Address, but it does show the hash of the public key.  

Bitcoin Addresses are composed of a network identifier and the hash of a public key. Knowing this, it is possible to generate a bitcoin address from the scriptPubKey and the network identifier.

```cs
var paymentScript = publicKeyHash.ScriptPubKey;
var sameMainNetAddress = paymentScript.GetDestinationAddress(Network.Main);
Console.WriteLine(mainNetAddress == sameMainNetAddress); // True
```   

It is also possible to retrieve the hash from the payment script (ScriptPubKey) and generate a Bitcoin Address from it:  

```cs
var samePublicKeyHash = (KeyId) paymentScript.GetDestination();
Console.WriteLine(publicKeyHash == samePublicKeyHash); // True
var sameMainNetAddress2 = new BitcoinPubKeyAddress(samePublicKeyHash, Network.Main);
Console.WriteLine(mainNetAddress == sameMainNetAddress2); // True
```   

> **Note:** The payment script (ScriptPubKey) not necessarily contains the hashed public key(s) permitted to spend the bitcoin.  

So now you understand the relationship between a Private Key, a Public Key, a Public Key Hash, a Bitcoin Address and a ScriptPubKey. Let me sum it up with the whole diagram and the corresponding code:  








```cs  
Key privateKey = new Key(); // generate a random private key
var mainNetPrivateKey = privateKey.GetBitcoinSecret(Network.Main);  // get our private key for the mainnet
var testNetPrivateKey = privateKey.GetBitcoinSecret(Network.TestNet);  // get our private key for the testnet
Console.WriteLine(mainNetPrivateKey); // L5B67zvrndS5c71EjkrTJZ99UaoVbMUAK58GKdQUfYCpAa6jypvn
Console.WriteLine(testNetPrivateKey); // cVY5auviDh8LmYUW8AfafseD6p6uFoZrP7GjS3rzAerpRKE9Wmuz
```  
```cs 
PubKey publicKey = privateKey.PubKey;
Console.WriteLine(publicKey); // 0251036303164f6c458e9f7abecb4e55e5ce9ec2b2f1d06d633c9653a07976560c
bool isPublicKeyNetworkIndependent =
    (publicKey == mainNetPrivateKey.PubKey)
    &&
    (publicKey == testNetPrivateKey.PubKey);
Console.WriteLine(isPublicKeyNetworkIndependent); // True
```  
 






So now you understand the relationship between a Private Key, a Public Key, a Public Key Hash, a Bitcoin Address and a scriptPubKey.

Private keys are often represented in Base58Check called a **Bitcoin Secret** (also known as **Wallet Import Format** or simply **WIF**), like Bitcoin Addresses.

For the rest of the book you will use an address that you have generated for yourself.

Note that it is easy to go from Bitcoin Secret to Private Key. It is important to remember that it is impossible to go from a Bitcoin Address to Public Key because the Bitcoin Address contains a hash of the Public Key, not the Public Key itself.

Bitcoin Secret: KyVVPaNYFWgSCwkvhMG3TruG1rUQ5o7J3fX7k8w7EepQuUQACfwE

Copy Bitcoin Secret you are presented, and add the following code to your main method in Program.cs, substituting the secret you were given for the one we have entered.

**Exercise:** Note your own generated private key that you will use in the rest of this book along with its address. I will store my private key in the variable **BitcoinSecret** **paymentSecret** for the rest of this book.

**Exercise:** Get the **Bitcoin Address** of the **paymentSecret**, store in in **paymentAddress**, and send some money on it from **Bitcoin Core**. Send something like 0.01 BTC, you can increase when if you feel more confident. ;)
