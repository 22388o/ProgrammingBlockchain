## Proof of ownership as an authentication method {#proof-of-ownership-as-an-authentication-method}

When I will release the next chapters, I will authenticate you with the key you used to pay me.

Do you remember when I said:

**Address:** 1KF8kUVHK42XzgcmJF4Lxz4wcL5WDL97PB**Signature:** H1jiXPzun3rXi0N9v9R5fAWrfEae9WPmlL5DJBj1eTStSvpKdRR8Io6/uT9tGH/3OnzG6ym5yytuWoA9ahkC3dQ=**Message:** Nicolas Dorier Book Funding Address

This constitute proof that I own the private key of the book.

You can verify that this is true with the following code.

True

And this is what I will use to authenticate you.

So if I give you the challenge:

**Message**: “Prove me you are 1LUtd66PcpPx64GERqufPygYEWBQR2PUN6”

You can prove it with your private key in the following way

True

This is how you’ll be prompted to prove your identity on [http://blockchainprogramming.azurewebsites.net/](http://blockchainprogramming.azurewebsites.net/)
