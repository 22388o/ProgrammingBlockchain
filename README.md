## Enhancing your learning process  
If you are committed to finish the book or a few chapters of it, it is a good idea to make smaller or larger contributions while reading. For example you could [choose an issue](https://github.com/ProgrammingBlockchain/ProgrammingBlockchain/issues) that can be only done if a big portion of the book is overseen. (Protip for university students: a good GitHub profile is more valuable in the job market, than a diploma.)
