# Second (Communitry) Edition 

([nopara73](https://github.com/nopara73)) I got sucked into Bitcoin in 2013. At the time everyone was talking about the countless great opportunities for developers, but I was not able to catch any of them.  
Every time I tried to code anything I have encountered countless walls, countless missing pieces and tremendous amount of work that needed to be done before I could even start.  

If I would have to describe the book in one sentence it would be this one: **Let's not talk Bitcoin, let's do Bitcoin!**
