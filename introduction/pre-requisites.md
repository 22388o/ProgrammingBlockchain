## Pre-requisites {#pre-requisites}

### Skills {#skills}

*   You need to be comfortable with object oriented as well as functional programming.
*   A basic grasp of C# is helpful, but we feel the code will be legible to Java and other C-based languages.
*   No mathematic knowledge is required. We will not cover cryptography beyond the bare minimum that you need to know to make a secure service.
*   You don’t need to have deep knowledge of Bitcoin. We do recommend reading Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos for extra credit.

### Tools {#tools}

*   Visual Studio 2013 - You can get it for free by searching for “Visual studio 2013 community” on ~~Google~~ Bing.
*   Bitcoin Core - You should have this synchronized before beginning.

Fact: You can ask Microsoft’s Cortana or Google Now for the exchange rate of Bitcoin.
