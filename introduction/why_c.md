## Why C#? {#why-c}

The .NET framework is popular in corporate environments. We also believe this is the perfect tool for startups and hobbyists.

*   .NET can create portable code that functions across IOS, Android, Windows tablets/phone, desktops, servers and embedded devices.
*   Everything from the compiler to the core runtime is open source.
*   The BizSpark program allows any startup to get all Microsoft tools, including $150/month of Azure service, for free.
*   Visual Studio Community 2013 is a professional grade IDE that you can use freely as hobbyist.
*   C# is closely related to Java and C++. As such, it can be easily read by developers who already know C syntax.
*   Nicolas Dorier, one of the authors of this book, created the most popular Bitcoin Framework for .NET, called [NBitcoin](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin).

The authors of this book have over 15 years combined experience with C#. It is our go-to language for any project for fun or profit.
