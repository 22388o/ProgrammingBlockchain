## Crowdfunding this book {#crowdfunding-this-book}

If we want to continue to make great stuff for you we need to buy pizza, coffee and sushi. It is our responsibility to get enough coins for that. Also, we’re too lazy to keep writing a whole book without hearing your feedback.

So we will start the following experiment that we hope you’ll find it interesting. Maybe one day you’ll flesh it out into a full business model.

We created this (don’t worry, we’ll see what each of these lines mean later)**Address:** 1KF8kUVHK42XzgcmJF4Lxz4wcL5WDL97PB**Signature:** H1jiXPzun3rXi0N9v9R5fAWrfEae9WPmlL5DJBj1eTStSvpKdRR8Io6/uT9tGH/3OnzG6ym5yytuWoA9ahkC3dQ=**Message:** Nicolas Dorier Book Funding Address

Now we’ll write the book. When we get hungry, we’ll pause and ask for help funding the next section of the book. You will send the money by completing a challenge in code, simply sending money with a wallet won’t count. Those who contribute will be able to access the next section by authenticating with their bitcoin address. There will not be any DRM. If you got the book without paying, it would be very kind of you to send payments as instructed throughout the book.

We’ll get into the specifics of unlocking the next section as we go along. Don’t expect it to be easy, you’ll have to learn how to do it through code!
